\par Foals are on their feet not long after being born. Chicks break through their shells and within hours are pecking around for food. Snakes hatch and just slithe away. Humans, on the other hand, are completely helpless at birth and remain dependent on their parents for many years.

\par So why does it take humans so long to develop? Why is such a intelligent species helpless for so many years? The quick answer, experts believe, is that humans are the most complex living system. And the more complex the system, the longer it takes to build.

\par The more involved answer has to do with evolution. It took billions of years for life evolve from single-celled microorganisms to large warm-blooded mammals. ``The ultimate cause of this evolution, the why and the how one genetic program is selected over another is not yet clear to us," says Calvin, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seatle. But researcher have identified some of the evolutionary factors that may have affected our developmental process, he says.

\par One of the factors dates back to around half a billion years ago, when two strategies for protecting offspring emerged. One group of species under a more-is-better strategy, where species produced thousands of eggs so the odds increased that some of them would survive to reporduce. The second group of species, which includes humans, took the opposite approach. They began having the longer the young are protected and taught the tricks of the trade, so to speak, the better chance they have of surviving to reproduce.

\par Another factor is called neoteny, a devempmental trend where a juvenile appearence is retained well past biological adulthhood(the age at which we can reproduce). Just the fact that we look young and vulnerable increase our chances of being taken care of.

\par Experts say it's likely that our development also is related to the gradual increase in human brain size over millions of years. Limited by the size of the female pelvis, we evovled in a way that allows for postnate brain growth. Because the brain plays a key role in the development of the body, this adaptation may have, in turn, forced the delay in much of our growth until we are outside the womb.

\par The higher intelligence and inquisitiveness of humans, our capacity for abstract thought and ability to plan ahead also play a huge role in our slow development. ``Humans are capable of doing things that no other species can," says Calvin, and it simply takes us a while to master the tasks that we need to survive.

\par Language is a good example of this. Learning a language and the specifics of grammar, syntax and context takes years, but humans are born with an innate drive to master it.\\

\par One of remarkable thing of laughter is that it occurs unconsciously. You don't decide to do it. While we can consciously inhibit it, we don't consciously produce laughter. That's why it's very hard to laugh on command or to fake laughter.

\par Laugher provides powerful, uncensored insights into our unconscious. It simply bubbles up from within us in certain situations.

\par When we laugh, we alter our facial expressions and make sounds. During exuberant laughters, the muscles of the arms, legs and trunk are invovled. Laughter also requires modification in our pattern of breathing. We also know that laughter is a message that we send to other people. We know this because we rarely laugh we are alone.

\par Laughger is social and contagous. We laugh at the sound of laughter itself.

\par The first laughter appears at 3.5 to 4 months of age, long before we're able to speak. Laughter, like crying, is a way for a preverbal infant to interact with the mother and other caregivers.

\par Contrary to folk wisdom, most laughter is not about humor; it is about relationship between people. To find out when and why people laugh, I and several undergraduate research assistants went to local malls and city sidewalks and recorded what happened just before people laughed. Over a 10-year period, we studied over 2000 case of naturally occuring laughter.

\par We found that most laughter does not follow jokes. People laugh after a variety of statements such as ``Hey, John, where ya been?" ``Here comes mary," ``How did you do on the test?" and ``Do you have a rubber band?". These are certainly are not jokes.

\par We don't decide to laugh at these moments. Our brain makes the decision for us. These curious ``ha ha ha's" are bits of social glue that bond relationships.

\par Curiously, laughter seldom interrupts the sentence structure of speech. It punctuates speech. We only laugh during pauses when we would cough or breathe.

\par When we laugh, we're often communicating playful intent. So laughter has bonding function within individuals in a group. It's often posivitive, but it can be negative too. There's a different between ``laughing with" and ``laughing at." People who laugh at others may be trying to force them to conform or casting them out of the group.

\par No one has actually counted how much people of different ages laugh, but young children probably laugh the most. At ages 5 and 6, we tend to see the most exhberant laughs. Adults laugh less than children. probably because they play less. And laughter is associated with play.\\

\par The blue haze represents X-ray emissions from hot gas between galaxies in the cluster MS1054-0321, 8 billion light-years away. What confines the gas within the cluster? Some propose that it's dark matter.

\par If gravity works the way it's supposed to, then most of the universe's mass in visible, existing as what's come to be known as ``dark matter." What's the nature of that missing mas, and what does it all mean for the fate of universe? The question lead to some of  the greatest mysteries of modern physicas.

\par Scientists haven't even figured out yet how much total mass the universe contains--a no-less-weighty question that is linked to the dark matter debate. Indeed, the nature and amount of dark matter determines whether the universe itself is fated to collapse back upon itself, expand into virtual nothingness or reach a state of quilibrium.

\par Right now, the best bet is that there isn't enough matter for gravity to overcome the Big Bang, meaning that the universe's current expansion will continue forever utils there's pratically nothing left. In fact, some scientist are puzzling over data indicating that the expansion is accelerating.

\par For a long time, cosmologists worked under the assumption that there is enough matter to bring the universe into an eventual balance. Cosmologists call this balance point the critical density, and they used a variable called ``omega" to describe the proportion of the universe's actual density to the critical density.

\par If omega equals one, the universe is in balance and all is well for most theoretical physicists. But if omega is much less than one -- as appears to be the case -- then the theoreticians have a lot of explaining to do. In fact, it may indicate that we don't fully understand how gravity works after all.

\par That's why some physicists hope there's enough undetected dark matter to fill the gap.

\par Figuring out the total mass of the universe may sound like an imponderable question--but surprisingly, Lawrence and other researchers hope to come up with some conclusive answers the next decades or so. Their strategy is to measure the uneven afterglow of the Big Bang's aftermath, known as the cosmic background radiation.

\par A satellite called the Cosmic Background Explorer has made a good start toward charting that afterglow. Future spacecraftsuch a NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the Enuropean Space Agency's Planck mission will map the early universe's signature in event greater detail. By closely comparing the density differences in the background radiation, astronomers can come up with an answer for the mass question and gain some new hints as to the nature of dark matter.

\par ``I think in 10 or 15 years we will known pretty much for sure whether the universe will expand forever, collpase back on itself or just drift," said Lawrence, who is a principal investigator for one of the Planck research teams. ``That's pretty exciting. That's a question that didn't exist 100 years ago."

A. is unlikely to collapse back upon itself\\
B. is still full of mysteries to be revealed by us\\
C. will continue to expand until nothing exists in it\\
D. will reach a state to equilibrium sooner of later\\

\par Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan laid forth the intellectual basis for the likely continued aggressive easing in monetary policy in the weeks ahead in his semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress.

\par The broader point in his prepared testimony is that the improved information and production controls evident in the new economy induce companies to respond more quickly and in tandem to changes in their bussiness. Mistakes are still made as is evidenced by the unwanted buildup of past, as evidentced by manufacturer's recent slashing of production.

\par Moreover, the increasingly dramtic shifts in economic activity are particularly hard on confidence. Consumers and bussiness literally freeze up due to the heightended uncertianty, and run from any perceived risks and curtail their spending and investment. If confidence deflates by enough, then a recession will ensue.

\par Confidence has also been under extrordinary pressure in recent months due to surging energy prices and weaker stock prices. Higher ennegy bills have acted much like a tax increase, save the checks are largely being written to foreign energy producers. The lower stock prices are having a magnified impact due to the dramtic increase in stock wealth since the mid-1990s.

\par The conduct of monetary policy must adjust to all of this, and thus respond more quickly and agressively than in the past in an effort to shore up confidence. This explains the dramatic and unprecedented action(at least by a Greenspan-led Federal Reserve) to cut the federal funds rate target by 100 basis points in January. This also suggests that substantially more easing is on the way in the weeks ahead. Just when and by how much will depend on whether confidence continue to fall.

\par The chairman made a point to note that policymakers have significant latitude to ease policy aggressively since inflation remains low and tame. Despite surging energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations remain contained.

\par The Federal Reserve's economic projections for this year provided as part of the testimony support this non-recessionary view. Real GDP is expected to grow by between 2\% and 2.5\% between the fourth quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of this year. Since this is below the economy's potential growth, the jobless rate will rise to approximated 4.5\% by year's end. Inflation will moderate somewhat in response.

\par Recession risks are rising and as high as they have been since the last downturn almost a decade ago. The key bufer between a soft economy and a recessionary one is confidence, and today's testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman clearly indicates that policymakers will be as agressive as they need to be to ensure confidence erodes no further. With just a bit of luck they will succeed.\\
